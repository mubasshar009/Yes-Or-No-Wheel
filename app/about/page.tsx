          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Yes or No Wheel was created with a simple mission: to help people make binary decisions quickly and
            randomly. We believe that sometimes the hardest part of decision-making is simply making a choice, and our
            tool aims to remove that friction.
          </p>

          <h2>What We Offer</h2>
          <p>
            The Yes or No Wheel is a free online tool that provides a 50/50 chance of getting either a "Yes" or "No"
            answer to any question. Unlike a simple coin flip, our wheel adds visual engagement and excitement to the
            decision-making process with its spinning animation, sound effects, and confetti celebration.
          </p>

          <p>Key features of our service include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A visually appealing spinning wheel with equal "Yes" and "No" sections</li>
            <li>Decision history tracking to keep a record of your past questions and answers</li>
            <li>A scoreboard to track the distribution of "Yes" and "No" results over time</li>
            <li>Sound effects and visual celebrations when the wheel stops</li>
            <li>Mobile-friendly design that works on any device</li>
            <li>Complete privacy with all data stored locally on your device</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            The Yes or No Wheel uses a cryptographically secure random number generator to ensure completely fair and
            unbiased results. Each spin has exactly a 50% chance of landing on "Yes" or "No." The wheel's animation is
            designed to create suspense and make the decision-making process more engaging.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you spin the wheel, it rotates for a few seconds before gradually slowing down to reveal your answer.
            The result is determined by where the pointer at the top of the wheel lands when it stops spinning.
          </p>
